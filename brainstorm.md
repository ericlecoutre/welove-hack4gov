# Proposed action plan ; to be discussed

Presentation + BI dashboard + Shiny app embryo

*	SPF is thinking about putting data at disposal of individuals
*	There are already many data available; directly public or that advanced users can prepare
*	With already public data for Wallonia, here are some example of stuff that can be done:
o	[listing of ideas + POC shiny/dashboard application]   <- this is the target priority 1
*	Having more data at disposal such as … would allow …  <- this is the target priority 2


# Dashboard ideas

* technology?
* relation between price/sqmeter, superficies (cadastre provides floor superficies) and fiscal income (3 covariates to display)
* agregate individual data at some level; for instance municipality level
  + derive municpality KPIs / metrics

# Shiny app ideas

* Search for an address
* Give much detail information for this address, including data enrichment (cf. below)




# Data enrichment; features derivation


* Distance to nearest neighbour
* Distance to nearest train station ; tec bus station
* Time to travel to main cities (OpenTripPlanner)
* Distance to schools
* Mobility index (must also incororate distance to autoroutes for instance)
* Woods density in a circle of x kms
* Enterprises densities in a circle of x kms
